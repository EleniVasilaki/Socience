Socience is a social media app designed specifically for the scientific community. It provides a platform for researchers, scientists, and academicians to share their findings, knowledge, and ideas with their peers and colleagues. With Σocience, users can create a profile, connect with other scientists and researchers in their field, share publications, posters, and presentations, join and participate in discussion groups and forums, follow the latest developments and trends in their field, and get notified of new research and opportunities. By using Σocience, scientists can stay up-to-date with the latest research and findings in their field, build their professional network, and expand their collaborations. With its simple and user-friendly interface, Socience makes it easy for scientists to share their work and increase their visibility and impact in the scientific community.

We made a new repository to build the project and upload the folders. The progress is saved to the [old repository](https://github.com/EleniVasilaki/Social-Network).

## How it works
- The structure of the repository (check  [old repository](https://github.com/EleniVasilaki/Social-Network)
where the progress is saved) is consisted of many branches.
- One branch is matched to each person of the team and each person took care of different classes.
- A part of the team was responsible for code reviews and use of tools where they ensured the smooth evolvement of the progress.
- For data storage we used txt files which were filled using different methods (Differantiation by lines or by columns)
- The .jar file is located in this repository among with the necessary files
